# Rick and Morty Universe

This is a pet project aimed to learn ReactJS. The project implies a web-application that allows you to get info about "Rick and Morty" series characters and episodes.

# TODO
1. I ran `yarn start`, but my project failed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Probably I need to install modules. Write about that in your README. You can also indicate your naming conventions, project rules etc.

2. Show loading indicator in case list is still loading. 

3. Show error message in case error was returned, instead of empty list container

4. We implemented input with debouncing on the workshop. Change search button to input debouncing.

5. Error 404 is not readable. Please, make it prettier :) You can also implement it as a separate page and redirect there, in case id is incorrect.

6. Show the most popular Rick & Morty phrases instead of the search bar in Detailed Character / Episode pages. A new phrase should show up every 30s.



## Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
